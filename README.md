# PrimeFinder
Finds all prime numbers between 2 and a given integer n. The integer may be as big as you want.
After finding such list, it writes it down in a text file (as one huge line).

It can do 2-1 million in 15 seconds, but since the time is not linear, from  2-10 million it takes 3 minutes and 15 seconds (may vary depending on your PC, maybe...?)
If you want to go full performance mode, you can remove/comment out the user feedback part, as it will have to go through one less if statement per number.

Made in 2018-ish, "finalized" in 2021.
